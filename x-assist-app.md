## Browser-based Web App

The browser-based web app is the preferred option for companies that generally restrict the installation of apps on company devices. Without downloading the app from the stores, users can use all platform functionalities via the browser, including sharing of geolocation and the emergency button.

## Native App

The X-ASSIST App for IOS and Android \([Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.exop_group.xassist&gl=IT) or [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/x-assist/id1489592901?l=it)\) offers the same functionalities as the desktop platform.
