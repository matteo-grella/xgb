# Executive Summary

The summary provides an overview of past and future security incidents in the country. You can directly screen the four latest incidents, get a picture of the incident frequency over the past months and see the most important incident categories for that country. 

This will help you better understand security developments on the ground and the biggest threats to your travellers. With the help of the “take care of” section, you can immediately see which topics need to be considered before and during a trip.
