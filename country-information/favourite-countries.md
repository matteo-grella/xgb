# Favorite Countries

If you are interested in specific countries, you can save them as favourites. What are the advantages? 

* **You can access them directly** from the country information page by selecting it from the list of favourites, which is displayed when you click/touch in the search bar on the left of the page. 
* More importantly, **you can receive country information alerts** if anything happens in the country. Just select “send me an alert”, then choose from which impact level on you wish to receive alerts and “save”. 
* **You can also receive risk level change alerts** in case the overall country risk level changes, called Risk Level Change Alert. 
* **You can receive information alert digests** for your favourite countries. Let’s say you want to receive once a week at 9:00am and overview of all events that occurred in the country over the past 7 days. Just go to “Alert digest”, define your individual settings and “save/ update” your favourite.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The alerts you receive are only information alerts about events occurring in the country. They include no recommendations and they are not linked to your location. Moreover, all permission levels have access to these settings, including travellers.
