# FAQ

## How do country information help risk prevention?

Country information provide a first overview about the risk profile of a country. Reading the information will give you a first indication if travelling to the place is dangerous for your travellers or not. It also recommends the implementation of specific risk mitigation measures to reduce the risks for your travellers and fulfil your duty of care.

## Where do the data come from?

Country and city risk layers as well as incidents are the outcome of the EXOP team’s work. All the security information is peer-reviewed by analysts. Business and corruption layers are derived from publicly available sources \(e.g. World Bank etc.\). The foreign ministry digest is calculated by an average of the respective country risk ratings by key foreign ministries incl. UK, US, Germany, Australia, France etc.

## Is the country information up to date?

Our aim is to provide updates in real time. All content is updated automatically and in all languages as soon as key information e.g. security risk levels have been verified and changed by EXOP’s analysts. We have no editors writing all these texts.

## Can I control what content my travellers can see?

Users with administrator permissions can define the content each user group \(traveller, manager, admin\) has access to, in the admin panel. Usually, travellers have no access to duty of care recommendations, business risks and liability recommendations.

## How can I change the language?

The platform’s content including all communication \(email and phone calls\) is available in several languages, among them French, German, English and many more depending on your company set up. Users can select their own language: They just need to go to their user profile and select the language they prefer.

## What is the difference between country information alert and the alerting in the travel monitor settings?

You can find the term “_alert_” for different kinds of information in the platform: 

* Country information alerts report events in the country regardless of your location or your company set up.
* Country information alerts do not trigger any emergency procedures or calls.
* Country information alerts do not include behavioural guidelines for travellers. Country information alerts serve as a source of information about current developments.

## What is the difference between risk level change alert in the country information and risk level change alert in the travel monitor settings?

When you activate the risk level change alert in the travel monitor alerting settings, your report recipients will receive email notifications upon risk level escalations or de-escalations in all countries worldwide. In addition, any user can register to receive those notifications on risk level changes for one or several specific countries. The individual risk level change alert is set up on the country information page. It will be sent to the email address of the user profile.
