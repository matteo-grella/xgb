# Admin Area

If you are an administrator of the platform you have additional rights. You can **view**, **edit**, **delete**, **add** and **invite** users to the platform. Also view, edit and delete **groups** and edit their permissions are possible. Organisation settings can also be changed. 

#### USERS 

It is easy to add or invite users. To add a user just click “_Add User_” and type in all the details. With this option you will need to communicate username and password to the user by yourself. If you click “_Invite Users_” the platform will send out an email to all given recipients with an invite to register themselves. This option enables you to add multiple users at once. 

**GROUPS**

In this section you can edit the existing groups and their permissions. You can also add new groups or delete old ones. If you hit the edit button you can change the name, change the permissions or specify if this group is the default group. Newly registered users are automatically added to the default group. Only one group in each organisation can be the default group. Please note: You are not allowed to delete the default group. Also, you cannot delete a group with existing users linked to this group. 

**ORGANISATION**

In the organisation section you can configure your company settings. In the Login configuration you can view your company login URL for email token login and specify the allowed domains. In the SAML section you can view and configure all settings for SAML. Please find an explanation of the different login mechanisms at the section sign-on interfaces. 

In the general settings you can specify the default language, default time zone, organisation logo and primary color. The default language and time zone represent the company’s standard for all users. Each user can change the language and time zone in their respective user profile individually.
