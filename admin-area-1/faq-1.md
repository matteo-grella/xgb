# FAQ

## How can users get an account?

There are different ways depending on the login procedure:

1. If the user registers via email token or SAML, the platform will automatically create a new user \(in the standard group\) as soon as the respective user clicks on the link. Please note that the email domain must be white-listed for using email token.
2. An administrator can simply add/invite users via the admin area. Multiple users can also be invited at once.

## How can I delete travellers or cancel trips?

It depends. Travellers that have been integrated into the platform via automatic transfer of travel data and don’t have a user account in the platform cannot be deleted, neither can their trips. All travellers having an account in the platform can be deleted, including all their trips. Single trips cannot be cancelled, except trips registered via calendar tracking. In this case, the traveller himself needs to delete his calendar event.

## What does it mean when an email address begins with “temp-email-…”?

This is not an error. In most cases, this is an email address that is temporary and not yet confirmed. For example, if you log in via email token, receive a link to register, but you never confirm your email with the link, the system will consider your email as temporary email.

## How long can I use the link received via email token login?

By default, the link is valid for 24h.

## Why does my colleague have a different language than me?

A company can set a default language for all users, but every user can set the preferred language for himself in the user profile.

## Why do travellers get emails not in their preferred language?

There is only one default language for all users in the platform. If a traveller wants to have a different language, he must have an account in the platform and change the language in the user profile.
