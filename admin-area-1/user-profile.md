# User Profile

## How can I manage my personal account?

The user profile of the platform is an important element. Here, users can manage their **personal account**. They can set their name, email and phone number that serve as main contact details for the platform in case of emergencies and any other information.

{% hint style="danger" %}
 The platform will prioritise contact details of the user profile over contact details from automatically transferred travel data, as any data provided by the person/ traveller is assumed to be more precise.
{% endhint %}

In addition, users can select their preferred language and time zone. If user’s login via _username_ and _password_, they can also change their password here. 

For additional safety they can also enable _two-factor authentication_ for their account. Users can also determine their personal country of employment in the user profile. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that a traveller does not receive PTI for this particular country if the PTI setting “ignore country of employment” is enabled.
{% endhint %}
