# Assistance Settings

## Who do you want to handle 24/7 assistance for you?

When your travellers need assistance, they need **ONE contact point**, **ONE phone number** they can call for help. In this section you select the first emergency contact point for your company. It will be this number that supports your staff 24/7 and worldwide. 

The platform leaves you two options detailed below: 

1. EXOP Operation Center
2. Your Own Emergency Setup

### 1. EXOP OPERATION CENTER

The EXOP Operation Center will handle 24/7 emergency assistance for you. 

* Travellers who reply with “help” to the automated status call will be forwarded to the EXOP Operation Centre. 
* The phone number of the EXOP Operation Centre is displayed as emergency phone number in all email communication related to travel security and assistance.
