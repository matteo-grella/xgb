# Permissions

## Can travellers see the travel monitor?

Users that are given permissions of the traveller group are not authorised to access the platformâ€™s travel monitor.

## Do travellers and managers receive the same alerts and special alerts?

Alerts and special alerts for managers are different than for travellers. Managers will receive additional information e.g. how many travellers have been affected by the particular incident, what is their respective status \(in a special alert\) etc.
