# Data

## What happens with travellers at the end of the trip? Will they be deleted automatically?

Travel data can be accessed until 30 days after the end of the respective trip, if the respective time frame is selected using the custom range button. Please note that by default, only current travels are displayed.

## How long can I see if a traveller was affected by a special alert?

The data is being deleted after 6 months.

## Can I do anything to improve data quality?

Over 70% of traveller data we receive is somehow incorrect. Spelling mistakes in names, missing or wrong phone numbers are the biggest challenges. We cannot contact travellers correctly if we do not have their correct emails or phone numbers. What can you do? Make it mandatory that travellers always enter and update their contact data in the platformâ€™s user profile. Also, if travellers are entering their correct name, phone number and email address during a travel booking, this will help significantly. For travellers that are travelling to high risk countries, make sure they use the calendar tracking as an addition. This way, based on a more precise localisation, both preventive and reactive measures will target the traveller more effectively.
