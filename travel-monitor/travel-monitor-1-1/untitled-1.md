# Assistance

## How can I integrate my own 24/7 emergency assistance provider?

Go to the assistance settings and select “Customer” instead of EXOP. Provide respective emergency contact details and your preferred provider will automatically be contacted in an assistance case.

## Can my travellers call the 24/7 emergency number without receiving a special alert?

This depends on your assistance provider. It is highly recommended to have a professional 24/7 assistance setup. If you choose EXOP as your provider, the EXOP Operation Centre will be there for you and your travellers 24/7.

## Can I write an email directly to my travellers out of the travel monitor or make a direct call?

Yes, select the traveller you want to contact using the filter. Click/touch on the phone or email icon in the traveller contact details, starting your phone or email client. This way, you can call or write an email instantly.

## How can I see my travellers and sites in the travel monitor?

Click/touch the icon for travellers and the traveller list will be displayed. Click/touch the icon for site and you will have your sites listed.

## Can I see details of a trip?

Yes, if you select a traveller from the list or in the map, the following trip details will be displayed, ordered by stops of the trip: the registered traveller location \(e.g. hotel\), the country, the coordinates and the duration of the respective stop. Please note that travel data from different sources \(PNR interface, calendar or manual registration\) cannot be merged yet. That is a feature to come soon.

## What happens if the assistance provider calls the company’s internal emergency contacts and no one picks up the phone?

This depends on the service provider you are using. If you choose EXOP, the Operation Centre will continue to try to contact the internal emergency contacts. In any case, if there is an immediate threat to the life of travellers, and no internal contact can be reached, EXOP will nevertheless support in order to save lives.

## In which time zone is the contact time \(call to travellers\) displayed?

Each user selects the time zone himself in the user profile. That is the time zone displayed in your account.

## Do we have to expect additional costs?

There are no hidden costs. Any costs that may arise in addition to the monthly fee, will be made transparent and must be authorised by the client. Please determine your authorising personnel, who are eligible to order fee-based services in the assistance settings section of the travel monitor. Please check your X-ASSIST contract for case fees.

## Can I use my own medical provider?

Yes, you provide details on your medical service provider with the X-ASSIST contract and EXOP will integrate your provider into the assistance procedures. If you choose a different provider for security assistance than the EXOP, you will have to coordinate the integration of your medical assistance provider with them.
