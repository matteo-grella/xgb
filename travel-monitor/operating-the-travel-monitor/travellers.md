# Travellers

You get the full overview of your travellers with one click on the traveller icon. On the travel monitor start page at one glance you can see: 

* the current traveller status overview, showing travellersâ€™ statuses of the past 72 hours
* the number of travellers located in low, elevated, high, extreme risk countries 

By default, the system shows you the information for current travels. If you need to know about past or future travels, use the custom range button and make your time frame selection. At any time, you can use the red button to initiate an automated status request for selected travellers to find out about their current status. That way, for example, you can have a daily status update on your travellers to high-risk countries. 

Click on a traveller icon or on a traveller in the list to display the details available: the contact details and the traveller locations that are registered with the system. Traveller locations disclose information on the different stops and stays of the traveller over time, including 

* the duration of each stop 
* the location \(coordinates and position on the map\) of the stop 
* the latest status call information, if applicable
