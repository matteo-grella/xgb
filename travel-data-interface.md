# Travel Data Interface

### TRAVEL DATA INTERFACE

The extensive automation of the platform is of no use if no trips can be registered and thus monitored. Therefore, we make travel data integration as easy as possible and offer several options of travel data transfer into the platform. Depending on your company technical and travel booking setups, you can choose the option that fits best. 

#### Automated transfer of travel data \(PNR Tracking/PNR Traveller Tracking\) â€“ Integrate the platform into your travel booking process

Travel data can automatically be pushed into the platform when integrated into your existing travel data process. Once it is integrated, no additional manual effort is necessary. All bookings and changes will be automatically transferred to the platform, including cancellations. There are two possibilities to achieve that: 

1. **Standing interfaces to the platform.** With this solution, you can directly connect your travel management systems to the platform via XML or REST.
2. **Interfaces from your travel management system or travel agency.** We can connect to all travel management providers and systems, as well as travel agencies via individually programmed interfaces.
