## What is the Risk Map?

The Risk Map is the heart of the platformâ€™s dynamic country information.

Zooming into the map reveals the EXOP risk ratings even below country level. It shows the risk of governorates and provinces, **down to cities and even city districts**. Having a closer look at important cities will show violet-marked **areas of higher risk for travellers**. You can select to display different information, **map types** and **layers**. 

Using events selection and event visualisation, you can generate a professional risk profile of a region based on the security incidents in the risk categories of your interest and in a certain time frame.

It is recommended to navigate the map using the **search bar**, especially if you know exactly what you are looking for. Just enter the name of the city or other place you want to look into.

### HEAT MAP

At one glance, the **heat map** shows you hot spots of risk. Defined by your filters, it shows you which areas are to be avoided and which areas require higher security measures. A threat that was acute three years ago does not necessarily have to be present today, which is why using the time filter is **imperative to get a clear answer to your questions.**
